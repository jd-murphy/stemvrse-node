        <strong>NASA<br/> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration?</strong> is an independent agency 
        of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States responsible for the civilian 
        space program, as well as aeronautics and aerospace research. President Dwight D. Eisenhower 
        established NASA in 1958 with a distinctly civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging 
        peaceful applications in space science. The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on July 29, 1958,
         disestablishing NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency
          became operational on October 1, 1958. Since that time, most U.S. space exploration efforts have
           been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the 
           Space Shuttle.

           Currently, NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the 
           development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew 
           vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight
            of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches. NASA science is focused on 
            better understanding Earth through the Earth Observing System, advancing heliophysics through 
            the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program, exploring bodies 
            throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as New Horizons, and 
            researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated 
            programs. NASA shares data with various national and international organizations such as from the 
            Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite.
